**The smart cleanup, analysis and health-check integration for Home Assistant.**

Most Home Assistant instances accumulate hundreds of dead entities, broken automations, database bloat, and silently-failing devices over time — and nobody notices until something breaks. **HA Optimizer** surfaces all of it automatically, so you can clean up with confidence.

> ⚡ *Set it up once. Let it scan. Know exactly what's cluttering your HA instance — and clean it up safely.*

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Smart Entity Scanner
- Scans **all entities, automations, scripts, and helpers** in one pass
- Assigns **risk levels** (Low / Medium / High) so you know what's safe to delete
- Detects: stale entities (no change in N days), orphaned registry entries, suspicious naming patterns (`test_`, `temp_`, `backup_`, etc.), and YAML-defined entities that can't be auto-deleted
- **Safety first** — smoke detectors, door/window sensors, locks, motion sensors, CO/gas detectors are **never** suggested for deletion (configurable)
- Outputs a `health_score` (0–100) for your HA instance

### 🗑️ Safe Purge Engine with Soft Delete
- **Soft delete by default** — disables entities instead of deleting them, fully reversible
- **Trash bin tab** — all soft-deleted entities are listed with timestamps, remaining days before auto-expiry, and a one-click restore button
- **Auto-expiry** — trash is cleaned up automatically after N days (configurable)
- Handles automations and scripts correctly (UI-created vs YAML-defined)
- Detects already-disabled entities and still tracks them properly

### 🧩 Add-on Manager *(new)*
A full-featured add-on control panel built right into the optimizer — no more jumping between HA menus.

- Lists **all installed add-ons** sorted by priority: updates available first, then running, then stopped
- Shows **live CPU % and RAM usage** per add-on, refreshing every 5 seconds automatically — no page reload needed
- **One-click actions**: Update, Start, Stop, and open add-on details — all without leaving the panel
- Clearly highlights add-ons with **pending updates** (old version struck-through, new version highlighted in blue)
- Summary chips at the top: total count, running count, stopped count, available updates count

### 🖥️ Real-time System Resource Gauges *(new)*
Always visible at the top of every tab — you never lose sight of your host's health while using any feature.

- **Three animated semi-circle gauges** for CPU, RAM, and Disk usage
- **Gradient color arc** that flows green → orange → red as load increases (0 → 50% → 100%)
- **Animated needle** that glides smoothly to the exact usage value
- Shows absolute values beneath each gauge (e.g. `6.6 GB / 23.2 GB` for RAM)
- Displays OS name, hostname, HA version, and kernel version
- **Refreshes every 5 seconds** automatically when the Add-ons tab is open; available on all tabs via the Refresh button

### 📡 Fingerprint Anomaly Detection *(unique)*
Compares today's HA behaviour **against your own historical baseline** (up to 30 days). Uses statistical methods (σ or IQR depending on available data) to detect:
- Abnormal spike in state writes (DB load surge)
- Unusual automation trigger volume
- Integration reconnect storms
- HA lifecycle event anomalies (unexpected restarts, reloads)

Confidence level grows with more baseline days (20% → 99%). Completely private — compares only against **your own** past data, never against other users.

### 🗄️ Recorder DB Analyzer
- Queries the recorder SQLite/MySQL database directly
- Identifies **top-writing entities** (DB bloat culprits)
- Detects **wasteful records** — many writes, few distinct states
- Generates a ready-to-paste **YAML snippet** for `recorder:` optimizations
- Domain-level write statistics

### 📊 Lovelace Dashboard Analyzer
- Reads `.storage/lovelace*` config files
- Flags: heavy/complex cards, missing entities, duplicate entity references, uninstalled custom cards, Jinja2 template cards, WebSocket push pressure
- Cross-references with recorder data to identify dashboard-driven DB waste

### 🌩️ State Storm Detector
- Finds entities updating state **abnormally fast** vs their domain baseline
- Includes severity rating, ratio vs normal, and suggested fixes
- Catches misconfigured sensors before they fill your database

### 🤖 Automation Dead Code Analyzer
- Scans all UI-created automations for **broken references**
- Checks: triggers pointing to removed devices, actions calling deleted entities/services, conditions using non-existent entity states
- Silent failures in automations are exposed before they cause problems

### 🔌 Integration Health Scorer
- Analyzes **7 days of recorder data** per integration
- Scores each integration (0–100) based on reconnect frequency and unavailability patterns
- Flags abnormal disconnection bursts vs rolling average
- Detailed score breakdown showing exactly which factors caused deductions
- Diagnosis messages: "📶 Possible RF interference or device too far from hub"

### 🎨 11 Built-in Themes *(new)*
Switch the entire panel's look with one click — your preference is saved automatically.

| Theme | Style |
|---|---|
| 🌌 Deep Space | Dark navy + electric blue (default) |
| 🟣 Midnight Purple | Deep dark + violet |
| 🌲 Forest Dark | Dark green + emerald |
| 🌅 Sunset | Warm dark + orange |
| 🌊 Ocean Light | Light blue — bright mode |
| 🪨 Slate Pro | Dark indigo + purple accent |
| 🌹 Rose Gold | Dark crimson + rose |
| ⚡ Cyber Neon | Near-black + cyan glow |
| 🟡 Amber Dark | Dark sepia + golden amber |
| 🧊 Arctic | Icy white — bright mode |
| 🧛 Dracula | Classic Dracula dark + soft purple |

### 🌍 13 Interface Languages *(new)*
The entire panel UI — every label, button, message, and error — is fully translated into 13 languages. Switch instantly from the language selector in the top bar; your choice persists across sessions. Backend diagnostics (dashboard findings, state-storm advice, health diagnoses, fingerprint anomalies) are translated too.

**Supported:** 🇻🇳 Tiếng Việt · 🇬🇧 English · 🇨🇳 简体中文 · 🇩🇪 Deutsch · 🇫🇷 Français · 🇳🇱 Nederlands · 🇵🇱 Polski · 🇸🇪 Svenska · 🇭🇺 Magyar · 🇨🇿 Čeština · 🇮🇹 Italiano · 🇵🇹 Português · 🇸🇮 Slovenščina

> **Adding a language:** copy the `en` block inside `const I18N` in `panel.html`, paste it as a new `xx: { … }` entry, add it to the `LANGUAGES` array above, then run `python3 tools/check_i18n.py` — it verifies key coverage, `{placeholders}` and HTML-tag parity across every language, and that every key the Python backend emits actually resolves. The same check runs in CI.

## 🚀 Using the Panel

Open the **🧹 HA Optimizer** panel from the HA sidebar. The panel connects automatically using the HA WebSocket session — **no token or extra authentication required**. Everything is done through the UI — no YAML or manual service calls needed.

> ✅ **No Long-Lived Access Token needed.** The panel uses Home Assistant's own authenticated connection, the same one your browser already has open.

The panel has **9 tabs** across the top:

---

### 📋 Scan Tab — Overview & Cleanup

The main tab. See your system health at a glance and manage unused entities.

1. **Click `🔍 Start Scan`** — the scanner analyzes all entities, automations, scripts and helpers (takes a few seconds)
2. The **Overview Dashboard** appears showing:
   - **Health Score** gauge (0–100)
   - Total entities, candidates to review, breakdown by risk (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low)
   - Trash count and last scan timestamp
3. The table lists all flagged items. You can **filter** by risk, type or source, and **search** by name or entity_id
4. **Tick the checkboxes** to select items, then use the floating action bar at the bottom:
   - **🗑️ Disable** → soft delete (reversible — entity moves to Trash tab)
   - **❌ Hard Delete** → permanent removal ⚠️ irreversible
   - **✕ Deselect** → cancel

> ⚠️ Always **backup your HA** before using Hard Delete.

---

### 📊 Recorder Tab

1. Click **`📊 Analyze Recorder`**
2. See DB size, top-writing entities, wasteful records and write stats by domain
3. Copy the **ready-to-paste YAML block** into `configuration.yaml` under `recorder:` and restart HA to reduce DB growth

---

### 🖥️ Dashboard Tab

1. Click **`🖥️ Analyze Dashboard`**
2. The panel reads your Lovelace `.storage/lovelace*` files and reports: heavy cards, missing/unavailable entities, duplicate references, uninstalled custom cards, Jinja2 template cards
3. Issues are marked **Critical** or **Warning**

> ℹ️ Only UI-mode dashboards stored in `.storage/lovelace*` are supported. YAML-mode dashboards cannot be read automatically.

---

### ⚡ State Storm Tab

1. Click **`⚡ Detect State Storms`**
2. Entities updating far more frequently than their domain baseline are listed with severity, ratio vs normal, and fix suggestions
3. These are the most common cause of database bloat and slow Lovelace

---

### 🔍 Dead Code Tab

1. Click **`🔍 Analyze Dead Code`**
2. UI-created automations are scanned for broken references: triggers pointing to removed devices, actions targeting deleted entities/services, conditions using non-existent states
3. Each automation with issues shows a direct **"Open Editor"** link to fix it immediately

---

### 💚 Health Tab

1. Click **`💚 Check Integration Health`**
2. Each integration gets a score (0–100) based on 7 days of reconnect and unavailability data
3. Problem devices show: reconnect count today vs daily average, battery level (if available), and diagnosis messages
4. Status badges: **Good** / **Warning** / **Critical**

---

### 🫆 Fingerprint Tab

Compares today's HA behaviour against your **own** historical baseline — private to your instance, never compared to other users.

**First-time setup:**

1. Click **`📥 Collect Baseline`** — saves yesterday's metrics snapshot
2. Repeat daily, or it runs automatically at **00:05** every night
3. After **3–7 days**, results become meaningful (confidence reaches 75%+)

**Running an analysis:**

1. Click **`🫆 Analyze Fingerprint`**
2. Results show confidence level, anomaly count, hours elapsed today (extrapolated to 24h for fair comparison)
3. Each anomaly shows today's value vs baseline average with the method used (σ or IQR)
4. ✅ green = normal · ⚠️ orange = anomaly detected

---

### 🧩 Add-ons Tab

Full add-on control panel with live host resource data.

- Lists all add-ons with status, version, and update availability
- Live **CPU % and RAM** per running add-on, auto-refreshing every 5 seconds
- **System gauges** at the top always show host CPU / RAM / Disk
- One-click **Update / Start / Stop** without leaving the panel

> ℹ️ Requires Home Assistant OS or Supervised (Supervisor API). Not available on Container or Core installs.

---

### 🗑️ Trash Tab

All soft-deleted entities appear here with the date they were disabled.

- **♻️ Restore** — re-enables the entity and removes it from trash
- **❌ Hard Delete** — permanently removes from HA
- Entities are auto-hard-deleted after the configured number of days (default: 7)

---

### Automation Example — Weekly Scan & Notify

```yaml
automation:
  alias: "HA Optimizer - Weekly Scan"
  trigger:
    - platform: time
      at: "03:00:00"
    - platform: template
      value_template: "{{ now().weekday() == 6 }}"  # Sunday
  action:
    - service: ha_optimizer.scan
    - wait_for_trigger:
        platform: event
        event_type: ha_optimizer_scan_complete
      timeout: "00:05:00"
    - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
      data:
        title: "🧹 HA Optimizer"
        message: >
          Scan complete. Found {{ trigger.event.data.statistics.candidates_found }}
          candidates. Health score: {{ trigger.event.data.statistics.health_score }}/100
```

## 🛡️ Safety

- **Soft delete is the default** — entities are disabled, not removed. Fully reversible.
- **Safety device classes are hardcoded** — smoke, CO/gas, moisture, motion, occupancy, door, window, lock, vibration, sound, battery, problem sensors are **never** suggested.
- **YAML entities are flagged, never auto-deleted** — they require manual action.
- **Risk scoring** — every result has a risk level so you make informed decisions.

---

## 🖥️ Compatibility

| | |
|---|---|
| Home Assistant | 2023.7+ (2023.1+ for most features) |
| Database | SQLite (default) and MySQL/MariaDB |
| Config | UI config flow — no YAML required |
| Dependencies | None — uses only HA built-ins |
| Python | 3.11+ |

> **Why 2023.7+?** The panel uses `return_response` on service calls (introduced in HA 2023.7). All other features work on 2023.1+.
